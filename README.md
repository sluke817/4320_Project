## Accessing the Application

The online application can be accessed using this url: https://e3aeaiux2p.us-east-2.awsapprunner.com 

We utilize a DynamoDB key-value database, which is provided by AWS. We cannot provide database access using traditional methods, but you are more than welcome to see our database by logging into AWS, going to Dynamo, and viewing the users table. This table is used for storing the user's username/password combos, as well as their information.
